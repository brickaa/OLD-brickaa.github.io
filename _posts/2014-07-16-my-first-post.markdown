Hi there. Learning Jekyll will super fun. I'm excited to see if it'll help me template the [*super dope*](http://apps.texastribune.org/hurting-for-work/) websites I've been building for our special investigative projects.

Sad note: Today my phone broke. It was really sad, so I had a cocktail at lunch. I also worked on a really cool website today. It broke too, but I figured out how to fix it. Yay Internet.

After a year-long fellowship covering women's health, I'm proud and excited to announce the new landing page for my "[Politics of Prevention](http://apps.texastribune.org/politics-of-prevention/new-limits-more-money/)" series. 

It includes three investigative pieces that I wrote for The Texas Tribune/New York Times, a new story by Alexa Ura on the changes ahead, interactive maps and graphics built by me and Ryan Murphy, a heart-wrenching video interview with a couple about their abortion produced by Justin Dehn, and amazing photography by Callie Richmond, Tamir Kalifa, Todd Wiseman, and others. 

The landing page is an extension of the platform that I built for Texas Tribune's "[Hurting for Work](http://apps.texastribune.org/hurting-for-work/)" project. Next up: Turning the design into a static template, so that it's easily reuseable. 

P.S. - As I type this, my cats are snuggling next to me like this...

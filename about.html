      <p>As a founding member of the The Texas Tribune’s news apps team, I've helped progress the Tribune's <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/about/">mission</a> to inform and engage Texas about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues. We develop news applications &mdash; visual features and data-driven editorial content for special investigative projects.</p>
      <p>I joined the Tribune in 2010, shortly after earning a bachelor’s degree in cultural theory from Scripps College in Claremont, CA. As a data reporter, I learned to develop interactive stories, and wrote about a myriad of political topics, including the economy, health care and the 2011 Texas legislative session. From 2012 to early 2014, my beat was health care, and during that time I was nationally recognized for my coverage of women’s health and abortion politics.</p>
      <p>In my unprofessional life, I'm a super nerdy lady from Austin. I have two cats, Stella and Lola. They're the stars of my  <a href="http://instagram.com/hello_becca">Instagram</a> account, and my life. On the weekends, you'll find me on my bike exploring. I like growing delicious vegetables in my garden. Also, I'm pretty sure I could live on tacos.</p>

	  <p>I develop news applications and work on special investigative projects for The Texas Tribune. My goal is to contribute to a new media model that promotes civic engagement and advances community interests.</p>
	  <p>I joined The Texas Tribune in 2010, shortly after earning a bachelor’s degree in cultural theory from Scripps College in Claremont, CA. As a data reporter, I developed interactive stories, and wrote about a myriad of political topics, including the economy, health care and the 2011 Texas legislative session. In 2012, I was promoted to cover health care for the Tribune, during which time I was nationally recognized for my coverage of women’s health and abortion politics. As a founding member of the Tribune’s news apps team, I decided to leave the health care beat in 2014 to work on news apps full-time. </p>
	  <p>In my unprofessional life, I'm a super nerdy lady from Austin. I like to bike and explore all the new places popping up in the city. And at the end of a long, hot Texas day, there's nothing better than going night swimming at Barton Springs. I have two cats, Stella and Lola. That's Steeeellllllaaaaaaa, and La-La-La-La-Lola to anyone who likes pop-culture references. They're the stars of my  <a href="http://instagram.com/hello_becca">Instagram</a> account, and my life. I'm usually growing delicious vegetables in my garden, except when the Texas heat becomes just too darn hot. When music is playing, my booty takes on a life of its own. I'm pretty sure I could live on tacos. And I like to paint. Mostly watercolors of silly things like triangles and foxes. </p>

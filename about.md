  <h3>Hi, I'm Becca.</h3>

  <p>I develop news applications and work on special investigative projects for The Texas Tribune. I joined the Tribune in 2010 with a passion for building a new media model that promotes civic engagement after earning a bachelor’s degree in cultural theory from Scripps College in Claremont, CA. In 2012, I was promoted to cover health care for the Tribune, during which time I was nationally recognized for my coverage of women’s health and abortion politics. As a founding member of the Tribune’s news apps team, I decided to leave the health care beat in 2014 to work on news apps full-time.</p>
  <p>Some cool things about me: I'm from Austin!  I like to bike around and explore all the new places popping up in the city, and at the end of a long, hot day dive right in to Barton Springs. I have two cats, Stella and Lola. That's Steeeellllllaaaaaaa, and La-La-La-La-Lola to anyone who likes pop-culture references. They're the stars of my  <a href="http://instagram.com/hello_becca">Instagram</a> account, and my life. Warning: when music is playing, my booty takes on a life of its own. I could live on tacos. And I like to paint. Mostly watercolors of silly things like triangles and foxes. </p>

  <h3>Hi, I'm Becca.</h3>

  <p>My "official" bio: Becca Aaronson develops news applications and works on special investigative projects for The Texas Tribune. As a native of Austin with a bachelor’s degree in cultural theory from Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., Becca joined the Tribune in 2010 with a passion for building a new media model that promotes civic engagement. She was promoted in 2012 to cover health care for the Tribune, during which time she was nationally recognized for her coverage of women’s health and abortion politics. A founding member of the Tribune’s news apps team, Becca left the health care beat in 2014 to work on news apps full-time.</p>
  <p>But here are some things you should really know about me...</p>
  <p>I have two cats, Stella and Lola. Yep &mdash; Steeeellllllaaaaaaa. They're the stars of my  <a href="http://instagram.com/hello_becca">Instagram</a> account. When there's music playing, my booty takes on a life of its own. I could live on tacos. Right now, there are eggplants, basil, peppers, honeydew, cucumbers and parsley growing in my garden. And sometimes I paint. Mostly watercolors of silly things like triangles and foxes. </p>
